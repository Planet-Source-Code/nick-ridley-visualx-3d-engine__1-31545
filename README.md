## VisualX \- 3D Engine


</div>

### Description

Well i decided to make a 3d engine, and this is as far as i have got. It can do ANY polygon that u can make. Runs at around 340 fps on my WinXP machine (1ghz,256mb ram, geforce 2 MX 32mb). I added a VisX editor to make your own 3d objects while seing them rotate in 3d space, then generate the code with 1 click. The only problem i have is i can get the drawing oders right so colours can be used on sides! If you can help please do! Please vote :). Nick
